# LC Gradio DocsAI ðŸš€

## Overview
LC-Gradio-DocAI is a demo project showcasing a privately hosted advanced Documentation AI helper, demonstrating a fine-tuned 7B model's capabilities in aiding users with software documentation. This application integrates technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, a vector store using Chroma DB or and FAISS and Gradio for a model UI to offer insightful documentation assistance. It's designed to help users navigate and utilize software tools efficiently by retrieving relevant documentation pages and maintaining conversational flow.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Documentation Retrieval:** Utilizes various fine-tuned 7B models for precise and context-aware responses.
- **Rich User Interface:** Features a user-friendly interface built with Gradio.
- **Advanced Language Understanding:** Employs LangChain for implementing RAG setups and sophisticated natural language processing.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Leverages Chroma DB and FAISS for optimized data storage and retrieval.
- **Retrieval Chain with Prompt Tuning:** Includes a retrieval chain with a prompt template for prompt tuning.
- **Conversation Memory:** Incorporates BufferMemory for short-term conversation memory, enhancing conversational flow.

## Models Used
This setup is tested with the following models:
- `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`
- `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`
- `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`
- `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha`
- `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct`
- `microsoft/Orca-2-7b`
- `teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B`
